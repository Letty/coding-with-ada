# Basic HTML and CSS

## Skeleton of a Website

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Loading Datasets</title>

    <!-- if you use files for styles and javascript-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    <script src="javascriptfile.js"></script>

    <!-- styles inside html file-->
    <style>
        body{
            color: blue;
            background: grey;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<script type="text/javascript"> 
    // javascript here
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

* Every element in html is called a "tag"
* most of the tags needs to be closed after opening. `<body></body>`, some just open `<link ...>`
* `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Declares the html document 
* `<html lang="en">` - Defines the language of the content(!) of your html document
* `<head>` - Information about the Website readable by other programs: who made the side, search engine terms, other files to include
* `<meta charset="UTF-8">` - Character Encoding - not every language has the same characters (remember the days where "?" appeared for ä,ö,ß ?)
* `<title>` - Titel of the Website
* `<link>` - Relation to other Documents / Resources
* `<script>` - Can execute script language or load script files
* `<style>` - CSS Stylesheets inside html file
* `<body>` - Contains all the content that a browser represents
