# Programing Languages

Links to images of language popularities, families and history. 

Note that the last two links tell us a slightly different story than what we saw in last week's video. Mainly that COBOL came in a year after FORTRAN and that Grace Hopper did not make COBOL but the basis for COBOL, which she called FLOW-MATIC.
